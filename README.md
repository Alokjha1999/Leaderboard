# Leaderboard Project

This project is a responsive leaderboard application built with React. It features an auto-scrolling footer, smooth animations for new entries, and a popup for adding new scores.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts seamlessly across different display sizes, ensuring that only the top 10 scores are shown.
- **Auto-Scrolling Footer**: Enhances user experience and aesthetic appeal of the page.
- **Smooth Animation**: When a new score is added, a smooth animation effect visually displays the new entry.
- **Dynamic Entry**: If the new score does not initially rank in the top 10, the leaderboard automatically scrolls to the correct position and smoothly inserts the new score.
- **Add Score Popup**: Allows users to add a new score with a username and a formatted score (MM:SS::MSS).

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: State management library for JavaScript applications.
- **CSS**: For styling and animations.
